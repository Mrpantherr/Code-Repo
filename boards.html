<h1><b>Artificial Intellegence</b></h1>
<p>
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) explores the theory and development of tools that simulate thinking, patterning and advanced
    decision behaviors through software running on computing devices. AI applications can solve and navigate complex scenarios
    that require drawing inferences appropriate to situations, performing decision-making using complex and changing data,
    discovering meaning and generalizing conclusions based on learned events and from experience. AI approaches within
    software form the underpinnings of autonomous devices, such as self-driving vehicles and drones. Technologies such as big
    data analysis, voice recognition, simulation agents and IoT devices all require AI algorithms. Studies in UATâ€™s Artificial
    Intelligence degree cover the fundamentals of general and applied AI, including core programming languages and platforms
    used in computer science. Advanced coursework encompasses applying principles of natural language processing, machine
    learning, behavior simulation and deep learning based on big data sets. Students prepare for future-oriented AI uses by
    applying computer science approaches and AI concepts as they develop solutions to real-world projects within production
    studio settings. The Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code for Artificial Intelligence is 11.0102.
